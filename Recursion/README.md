## **Recursion Notes**

### **What is Recursion?**
:point_right: The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

### **Pin Points**
:pushpin: **A recursive algorithm must have a base case.**\
:pushpin: **A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.**\
:pushpin: **A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.**\
